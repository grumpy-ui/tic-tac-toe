Known bugs:

1. When restarting the game, you have to get out of the current selection for it to work again.
2. The human input box doesn't clear out the last input value. Ex: if you select C1, reset the game and then choose another game mode, the C1 value will appear in the input field.
3. When AI wins, "Player X wins" is being displayed
4. After winning, you can still play.
